# Protein Protein Interactions
Introduction:
Project contains three machine learning algorithms that will attempt to classify protein-protein interaction data into either successful interactions, or unsuccessful. Each model is self contained in the respective Python file. Simple run the file and the model will run automaticall. Each file contains an array called 'energy_labels' and 'struct_labels'; this is where the metrics/ features are contained.

Train_nn:
Contains a multilayered neural network.

Train_snn:
Contains a perceptron.

Train_svm:
Contains a support vector machine.
