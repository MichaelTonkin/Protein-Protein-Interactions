# Protein Protein Interactions

Project contains three machine learning algorithms that will attempt to classify protein-protein interaction data into either successful interactions, or unsuccessful. Each model is self contained in the respective Python file. Simply run the file and the model will run automatically. Each file contains an array called 'energy_labels' and 'struct_labels'; this is where the metrics/ features are contained.

Train_nn:
Contains a multilayered neural network.

Train_snn:
Contains a perceptron.

Train_svm:
Contains a support vector machine.
